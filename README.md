# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to detect fraudulent credit card activity. There are multiple additional metrics like Precision, Recall, and F-1 Score due to the heavy inbalance of no fraud vs fraud.There are 28 independent variables labeled as V1-V28 to protect customers' privacy, and 1 dependent variable to identify yes or no fraud. 0- no, 1- yes.
  This project is a great example of how credit unions, insurance agencies, and other fiduciary entities are able to support their customers and protect themselves from fraudulent activities.
